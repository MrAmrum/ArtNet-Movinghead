# ArtNet-Movinghead
Control Movingheads with a Joystick

This Project is designed to conrtol multiple Movingheads with a Joystick or Gamepad.
Its taylored to my needs for a theater since i wanted to replace the Follower Spot with two Movingheads.
Softwrae output is made via Art-Net to connect to my DMX Control Software

As of yet it works but its still a bit funky.
