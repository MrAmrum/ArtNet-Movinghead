# ArtNet-Movinghead
Control Movingheads with a Joystick

This Project is designed to conrtol multiple Movingheads with a Joystick or Gamepad.
Its taylored to my needs for a theater since i wanted to replace the Follower Spot with two Movingheads.
Softwrae output is made via Art-Net to connect to my DMX Control Software

As of yet it works but its still a bit funky.

This is a working Version that can be used as a base for other Projects but for this to be a "finished" tool there is still a way to go.
